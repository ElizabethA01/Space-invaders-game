## General Information
- Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead.
- The purpose of the project was to improve my skills in creating a game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
- I undertook the project as part of a Boolean coding week challenge that I volunteered to attend. 


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript - version ES6
- HTML - version 5.0
- CSS - version 3.0


## Features
- Moving and shooting aliens


## Setup
The project is located on Codesandbox.io


## Usage
The player controls a spaceship that scrolls side to side and shoots upwards wave after wave.
User has to click left/ right key buttons to move and spacebar to shoot. 


## Project Status
Project is: _completed_. No longer working on it, because I completed the project as part of a Boolean coding week challenge.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Add levels where the aliens move faster after passing each level.
- The user can't restart the game.
- Adding power ups for the spaceship.

To do:
- Adding levels.
- Adding a play again button (completed)

## My Thoughts
During the process of creating this game, I really enjoyed the different aspects such as recreating the concept and adding visuals. As I'm interested in gaming, it was insightful to see a game to life from start to finish.
